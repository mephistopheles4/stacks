# Issue tracker: GitHub

Issues and PRDs for this repo live as GitHub issues on
[`mephistopheles4/stacks`](https://github.com/mephistopheles4/stacks). Use the
`gh` CLI for all operations; it infers the repo from `git remote -v` when run
inside a clone.

**These conventions are for agents working with the engineering skills
installed. They are not a requirement for contributing** — see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md). Nothing here gates a pull request.

## Conventions

- **Create an issue**: `gh issue create --title "..." --body "..."`. Use a heredoc for multi-line bodies.
- **Read an issue**: `gh issue view <number> --comments`.
- **List issues**: `gh issue list --state open --json number,title,body,labels,comments --jq '[.[] | {number, title, body, labels: [.labels[].name], comments: [.comments[].body]}]'` with appropriate `--label` and `--state` filters.
- **Comment on an issue**: `gh issue comment <number> --body "..."`
- **Apply / remove labels**: `gh issue edit <number> --add-label "..."` / `--remove-label "..."`
- **Close**: `gh issue close <number> --comment "..."`

## Pull requests as a triage surface

**PRs as a request surface: no.** _(Set to `yes` if this repo treats external
PRs as feature requests; `/triage` reads this flag.)_

GitHub shares one number space across issues and PRs, so a bare `#42` may be
either — resolve with `gh pr view 42` and fall back to `gh issue view 42`.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a GitHub issue.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Run `gh issue view <number> --comments`.

## What this repo expects of a change, whatever opened it

`main` is protected by a ruleset with no bypass actors: a pull request is
required, and the `gates` check must pass. That check is the contract, not any
convention above it. Before proposing a change, run:

```bash
pnpm test && pnpm build && pnpm gate:public && pnpm smoke:render
```

A defect worth fixing is usually worth a named gate that goes red — see
[`docs/gates.md`](../gates.md). An issue describing a defect is more useful when
it says which gate *would* have caught it, or that none would.
