# Progress

**Read this first.** It is the only file that says where the project actually is.

This is an **index, not a narrative**. One line per event, newest phase last.
Gists and links — never restate the plan. If you find yourself explaining *what*
a phase does here, it belongs in [`plan.md`](./plan.md) instead.

Update it in the **same commit** as the gate it describes.

## Current state

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Last green gate** | Phase 2 — shelf renderer |
| **Now working on** | Phase 3 — public build |
| **Blocked on** | nothing |
| **Next stop point** | none left — run to Phase 3's gate |
| **Out of scope this run** | Phase 4 (Audiobookshelf) |

## Gate log

| Phase | Gate | Status | Commit |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 — scaffold | `stacks --help` lists commands · empty shelf renders · fixtures committed | ✅ green | tag `phase-0` |
| 1 — data layer | `stacks build` → valid `library.json` · malformed skipped · 4 test cases | ✅ green | tag `phase-1` |
| 2 — shelf | `pnpm smoke:render` → non-blank `artifacts/shelf.png` · 50 books · click opens card | ✅ green | tag `phase-2` |
| 3 — public build | `--public` output has zero canary hits · OG image generated | ⬜ not started | — |

Every phase additionally requires `pnpm test && pnpm build` green.

### Phase 1 evidence

- `pnpm test` → 7 files, **62 tests** passed · `pnpm build` clean
- `pnpm stacks build --vault fixtures/vault` → **8 books**, 2 warnings naming
  `The Undelivered Manuscript.md` and `Untitled Import.md`, silent on
  `On Reading Slowly.md`, exit 0 — matching `fixtures/README.md` exactly
- Gate's four cases covered against **real captured** responses: ISBN hit,
  fuzzy title, API miss, malformed frontmatter. No test touches the network.
- End-to-end `stacks add 9781603580557` into a scratch vault: note written,
  real cover downloaded, spine colour extracted, re-running deduped correctly.

### Phase 2 evidence

`pnpm smoke:render` green: 49 of 50 fixture books shelved (wishlist excluded),
715 distinct colours, 40.1% non-background, and a click on a real book opened
its card ("Ember Protocol: Notes on Craft"). Screenshot at `artifacts/shelf.png`.

Aesthetics review came back with three directions, all applied: real bookcase
feel (continuous fill at real proportions, not one sparse row per year),
wishlist books stay off, and spine colour sampled from the cover's binding edge
so it matches the real spine. See the Decision Log for each.

## Environment findings

| Finding | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Node / pnpm / git | ✅ Node 24.14.1, pnpm 11.18.0, git 2.55.0 (Windows) |
| `@stacks/core` resolves under tsx + vitest + astro/tsc | ✅ verified |
| Headless Chrome for Phase 2 | ✅ system Chrome present; use `channel: 'chrome'`, no download |
| `.astro` files are NOT typechecked | ⚠️ `astro check` can't run under TS 7 — keep logic in `.ts` |
| **`node -e` with ESM top-level await exits silently** | ⚠️ prints nothing, exit 0. Put scripts in a file and run with `pnpm tsx` |
| **Bash tool sandbox blocks network** | ⚠️ outbound `fetch` needs `dangerouslyDisableSandbox` |
| Google Books unauthenticated | ⚠️ 429s on a shared quota — a bonus, never a dependable fallback |
| Resolved versions | TS 7.0.2 · Vitest 4 · Astro 7.1.6 · three 0.185.1 · sharp 0.35 |

## Notes to the next session

**Phase 3 starts here.** The shelf works and reads from `library.json`.

- `stacks build --public` already strips `sourcePath`, and `library.test.ts`
  asserts the public payload carries no note body, no `Library/`, no `.md`.
  What Phase 3 still needs: covers copied into the output, the OG image, and a
  **grep gate over the built folder** — the existing check is over the JSON, and
  the gate is about what actually ships.
- The canary is `NOTE_BODY_CANARY_do_not_ship`. It is in fixture note bodies
  *including the malformed one*, so a passing grep cannot be an accident of that
  book being skipped.
- Covers currently reach the site by a manual copy into
  `packages/site/public/covers/`. That is fine for the dev loop and **not** good
  enough for `--public`; the public build should place them itself.
- sharp is already a dependency and is what the OG image should use — that was
  half the reason for choosing it in Phase 1.
- Still open, and fair to decide in Phase 3: whether the print and audiobook
  editions of one title should collapse into a single spine. Wishlist is settled
  — off the shelf.
- Everything in `fixtures/` is invented. No copyrighted material, ever — see
  `plan.md` §1.
